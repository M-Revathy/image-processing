<h2>Object Detection and Classification Using Pre-Trained Models</h2>
This project involves performing object detection and classification on a set of input images using the following pre-trained models:

**1. Faster R-CNN with FPN:**
Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) with FPN (Feature Pyramid Network) model looks at an image in two steps: first, it finds potential objects, and then it closely examines those areas to identify what they are. The FPN helps it see both big and small objects more clearly.

**2. YOLOv8:**
YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8) is like a quick scanner that can look at an image and instantly tell you what objects are in it, all in one go. Itâ€™s built to be fast and accurate, even better than its earlier versions.

**3. YOLOv5 Fog:**
YOLOv5 fog model is a specialized version of the YOLOv5 object detection model, designed to handle images with foggy or hazy conditions. It adapts the standard YOLOv5 architecture to improve detection accuracy in low-visibility environments by incorporating techniques like dehazing or enhancing features that are often obscured by fog.

**Differences:**
<br>> **_Steps:_** Faster R-CNN checks the image twice (finds objects, then identifies), while YOLO models do it all at once.
<br>> **_Speed:_** YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are faster and better for tasks where speed is crucial, like real-time video.
<br>> **_Detail:_** Faster R-CNN with FPN is better at spotting small details, while YOLO models focus on speed.


<h3>Process Overview</h3>

**i) Input Images:**
<br> Place the images you want to process in a designated folder (/input/).
<br> **ii) Model Iteration:**
<br> The script will iterate over each image in the folder.
<br> For each image, the object detection and classification will be performed using the pre-trained models listed above.
<br> **iii) Detection and Display:**
<br> For each image, the model will generate bounding boxes around detected objects.
<br> The detected objects will be classified, and their names will be displayed on the image along with the bounding boxes.
<br> **iv) Saving the Output:**
<br> The processed images (with bounding boxes and object names) will be saved in separate folders inside the output folder named after each model (e.g., /output/model_output/).

<h3>Folder Structure</h3>
> _/input/:_ Contains the input images to be processed.
<br>> /_output/faster_rcnn_output/:_ Contains the output images processed by the Faster R-CNN with FPN model.
<br>> _/output/yolov8_output/:_ Contains the output images processed by the YOLOv8 model.
<br>> _/output/yolov5_fog_output/:_ Contains the output images processed by the YOLOv5 model.
